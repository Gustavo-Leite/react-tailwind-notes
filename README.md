## Notes App

### I developed a Notes application during the week of Rocketseat's NLW event, using the Vite build tool. To create this application, I employed a variety of modern technologies, including React, Radix-UI, Tailwind and TypeScript.

#

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
